# Elements-of-Software-Design

Scope of the Course
This is the second course in the Elements of Software series. I assume that you know a programming language (C / Java / Python) at the level taught in CS 303E. The emphasis of this course will be on software development using object-oriented methodology. I will not teach you basic Python syntax in this course.
We will learn how to analyze and design software. We will learn how to create reusable software components and to compose programs from already available components. We will learn about some basic data structures and algorithms and how to match the data structures and algorithms to problems. We will test and evaluate programs for their functionality and their performance.

In this course you will learn how to solve computational problems. Given a computational problem you should be able to Analyze (understand in detail) the problem Design an algorithm to solve the problem. In this design process you will choose the appropriate data structure and the most efficient algorithm Code the algorithm in Python 3 Write your own test cases to test your algorithm. You will pay careful attention to edge cases. Make sure that the output matches the format as specified. This is a programing intensive course.
